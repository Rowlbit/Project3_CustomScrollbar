| In order to work on both coding and refresh my knowledge on web development, I decided to create 100 projects that will be both practice and portfolio-worthy.*

Project 3 is a custom scrollbar that consist of HTML and CSS only. The things that I learned are in the comments that is on the bottom of each file. I will potentially add more comments over the time in their respective files.
